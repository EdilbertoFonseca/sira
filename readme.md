## Description

**SIRA** (an acronym in Portuguese for *Sistema Interno de Ramais e Anotações*) is an add-on designed to improve internal communication and the recording of essential information within the Health Department.

Developed with a focus on accessibility and efficiency, SIRA allows professionals to quickly and efficiently:

* Register and consult telephone extensions for all departments;
* Record messages intended for the transportation sector;
* Log medical discharge notes for monitoring and control;
* Write down general notes and internal messages in a centralized way.

Its interface is fully compatible with screen readers like **NVDA**, ensuring a smooth and inclusive experience for visually impaired users.

Ideal for daily use in public and administrative environments, **SIRA** enhances information management and reduces communication failures, contributing to more agile and organized processes.
